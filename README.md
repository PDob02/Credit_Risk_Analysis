# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17 Machine Learning

This analysis was done to predict credit risk by looking at attributes associated with low-risk & high risk loans for the bank. We used several methods including oversampling, SMOTE, undersampling & others to predict this risk. While none of these models were perfect, they all showed us different ways to evaluate the samples that were given to us.
